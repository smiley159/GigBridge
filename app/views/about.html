                    <p class="section-paragraph">Nowadays, live music and performance are the heart and soul of music industry.
There are various pain points in the music industry of Thailand that we are trying to ease:<br><br>
 -Event planners and artists often waste extra budget for booking agencies, resulting in unnecessary extra costs. <br><br>

 -The process of finding and booking artists is unreachable, hard, ineffective, and come with unfair price.<br><br>

 -There is no platform that combines all trending artistsâ€™ profiles, calendars, and upcoming events for people to check them out in one stop.<br><br>

Our mission is to disrupt booking agencies by eliminating unfair prices in the market, make artist booking reachable, and assist our artists in finding them more stages to perform.
